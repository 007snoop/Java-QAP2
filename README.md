> 1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

This took me about 4 days in total.
> 2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

I used the practice sheets given out during the week, I am also a part of an open sourced project, which is coding mainly in java, but we are translating to kotlin.
> 3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

No, I actually helped a few people with this one.
> 4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

The only real question was asking about using the code provided. I wasn't sure if i needed to write my own test file or use the provided one.
> 5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

I do wish to make a little more practice with the last question, that was not easy. Instructions were *half* clear. 
The first question was easy. I still am not sure if i ran the tests correctly.
